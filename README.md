what can you use markdown language for ?
style text on the web using special characters/ symbols

you can do basic styling like mking the text bold , italic or underlined
or style text for special purposes like codes links or images 
where these things can be integrated with the page content and be presented nicley and neatly


how to use is (synatx)?
* creating headers: add (#) before the header text 
* emphasising text : insert text between (*) to make the text italic
                      between (**) to make the text bold
                      between (***) to combine both
* embedding code : use ('') for inline code and 4 spaces to create a code section for longer codes
