## how do computers work

### what makes a computer, a computer

a computer has to perform different tasks whether it is a new computer or an old computer.
The common tasks all computers do:

* take input
* store information
* process information
* output the result

### binary and data

data is stored electrically as bits. one bit can be on or off (1 or 0).
More bits mean more complex data.
Hence the binary numbers system was created. the system depends on the digit having one of two values 0 or 1. If you have 8 binary digits you can count from 0 to 255 ( 2^8= 256 numbers in total ).
One of the ways to store text in binary is the ASCII code where each letter corresponds to a number.

### circuits and logic

inputs and outputs can be represented by ON or OFF electrical signals.
A computer processes input signals using circuits and convert them to output signals.
Electrical circuits are represented by logic functions/gates.
Most popular logic gates:

* NOT: the output signal is the oposite of the input.
* AND: If one of the inputs is 0 the output is zero.
* OR: If one of the inputs is one the output is one.
* NAND: AND followed by a NOT gate.
* NOR: OR followed by a NOT gate.
* XOR: (exclusive OR) if the inputs are similar the output is zero and if the inputs are different the output is one.

The modern computers are faster because the circuits are smaller.
