# building websites 
## Getting started

##### important things to consider when building a site 

* The website's target audience : - age - gender -region  - individual or company 
* The reason of visit : design content according to the motivation and goals of the visitors
* what do they want to achieve 
* what info they need : on the product or the organization 
* how often do they visit 

##### what information needed in order to achieve the audience goals quickly and effectively.

* do you need to introduce yourself?
* do they need background information on your product?
* What are the features of what you are offering?
* What is special about what you offer?
* are there common questions people ask about?


## design 

After figuring out the content the **first** step is to create a site map of how the pages connectd and grouped together to make navigation easier and more effective.
when designing site navigation make sure the design is:
 * concise 
 * clear 
 * selective
 * in context 
 * interactive
 * consistent

**second** step is to create a wireframe of how the site will look like, nothing fancy just a simple sketch.
**lastly** combine the content and the design using HTML to create the final pages layout.

its structure.
XX The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).
XX Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.
XX To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.
