# building websites 
## Getting started

##### important things to consider when building a site 

* The website's target audience : - age - gender -region  - individual or company 
* The reason of visit : design content according to the motivation and goals of the visitors
* what do they want to achieve 
* what info they need : on the product or the organization 
* how often do they visit 

##### what information needed in order to achieve the audience goals quickly and effectively.

* do you need to introduce yourself?
* do they need background information on your product?
* What are the features of what you are offering?
* What is special about what you offer?
* are there common questions people ask about?


## design 

After figuring out the content the **first** step is to create a site map of how the pages connectd and grouped together to make navigation easier and more effective.
when designing site navigation make sure the design is:
 * concise 
 * clear 
 * selective
 * in context 
 * interactive
 * consistent

**second** step is to create a wireframe of how the site will look like, nothing fancy just a simple sketch.
**lastly** combine the content and the design using HTML to create the final pages layout.




## How old browsers understand new elements

addin the following lines to your CSS file and HTML file will solve the problem.
```CSS
header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure
{
display: block;}
```
```HTML
<!--[if lt IE 9]>
<script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/
trunk/html5.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```

## HTML5 layout elements

>The new elements introduced in HTML5 provide clearer code instead of having only one block element (div) . Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

* div and span
* article
* section
* header and footer
* fgcaption and figure
* hgroup 
* aside
* nav
* iframes

## final notes


* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
