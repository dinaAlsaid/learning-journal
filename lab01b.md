# Growth Mindset

## What does it mean to have a Growth mindset?
having a growth mindset means that the person beleives that learning something is not bounded by the person having intelegence or talent -even if it gives a good headstart- but is dependent on the drive to learn and continuous effort.

On contrast, a fixed mindset believes that in order to achieve anything or to learn something new you have got to have a natural talent or a certain level of intellegence therefore giving up on learning new thing just because they do not see themselves as a good fit.

The following figure highlights the contarsting mindsets when presented with problems that need to be overcome.

## Adapting to the growth mindset

#### In order to have a growth mindset one should do the following:
* **Embrace** the challenges instead of avoiding them.
* **Presist** when obstacles present themselves instead of losing focus.
* Admit that **effort** is needed even if sometimes it feels like it is useless.
* **Learn** from given critisism and do not ignore it 
* Remember that the success of others should be considered as an **inspiration** not as a threat.

This mindset is not expected to be natural for everyone, therefore it needs practice and time to convert a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.
